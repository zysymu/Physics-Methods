# Physics-Methods
This is a compilation of some algorithms and computational methods I did applied to physics as a part of my major.
Some of them are not exactly as efficient as they could be, but you can see that I try to test out different ways of writing the code (just for funsies) in order to find something that can be pretty reusable and easy to understand.
I'd love suggestions on how to make some implementations more smooth-looking. I hope this can be helpful or interesting to you :)
