# Physics-Methods
This is a compilation of some algorithms and computational methods I did applied to physics as a part of my major.\ <br/>
Some of them are not exactly as efficient as they could be, but you can see that I try to test out different ways of writing the code (just for funsies) in order to find something that can be pretty reusable and easy to understand. I did everything in _Python 3_, since there was always a need for plotting the results and _matplotlib.pyplot_ enabled me to it all inside the program.\ <br/>
I'd love suggestions on how to make some implementations more smooth. I hope this can be helpful or interesting to you :)
