# Physics-Methods
A compilation of scientfic programming algorithms and computational methods applied to physics. <br/>
Some of them are not exactly as efficient as they could be, but I try to test out different ways of writing the code (just for funsies) in order to find something that can be pretty reusable and easy to understand. I did everything in _Python 3_, since there was always a need for plotting the results and _matplotlib.pyplot_ enabled me to it all inside the program. <br/>
I hope this can be helpful or interesting to you :)
